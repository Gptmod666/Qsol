## Current Issues / Blockers

- No live API endpoints for tokenService yet, using mock data.
- Linting fails in environments without dependencies installed.

## API / Function Notes

- `getTokenInfo(address)` in `src/lib/tokenService.ts` should feed a token detail component.
- `useMarketData()` from `src/lib/marketData.ts` powers the market overview page.
- `startSnipe(config)` from `src/lib/sniperService.ts` is triggered from SniperConfig page.
- Transaction management via `src/lib/transactionStore.ts` already wired to Transactions page.
