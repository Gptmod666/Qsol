## Current Issues / Blockers

- No live API endpoints for tokenService yet, using mock data.
- Linting fails in environments without dependencies installed.
- Redux store unified with wallet slice for balance tracking.

## API / Function Notes

- `getTokenInfo(address)` in `src/lib/tokenService.ts` should feed a token detail component.
- `useMarketData()` from `src/lib/marketData.ts` powers the market overview page.
- `startSnipe(config)` from `src/lib/sniperService.ts` is triggered from SniperConfig page.
- Transaction management via `src/lib/transactionStore.ts` already wired to Transactions page.
- `useSolanaBalance()` in `src/hooks/useSolanaBalance.ts` and `getWsolBalance()` from `src/lib/solana.ts` provide wallet balances for Dashboard.
- Balances are dispatched to Redux from `WalletDetails` for use across the app.
- Analytics currently uses mock data in `src/pages/Analytics.tsx`; needs real stats connection.
