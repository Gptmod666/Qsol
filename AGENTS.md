## Feature Status
| Feature | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Dashboard with wallet info | In Progress |
| Sniper configuration | Working |
| Transactions log | Working |
| Market data view | Working (API cached) |
| Analytics graphs | Mock data |
| Settings & theme | Working |

## Bugs / Blockers
- Market and analytics use mock or cached data when API fails
- No backend endpoints for real trading stats
- Linting may fail if dependencies are missing

## Notes
- `useSolanaBalance` + `getWsolBalance` fetch wallet balances
- `sniperService.startSnipe` triggers mock trades and stores them via `transactionStore`
- Transactions persist in `localStorage`
- Real analytics still needs data connection and should replace the mock in `Analytics.tsx`
